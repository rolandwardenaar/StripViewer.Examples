Stripviewer 

A clickable area can be created from  
- individual images ( the image becomes clickable )
- a single large image with numbers ( a button is placd on the numbers in the image )


This example is written in Dotnet Core, but the use of StripViewer is platform and language independent.
The StripViewer is a simple Html-tag that can be placed in any web-page. It uses Json-data that needs to be provided by the backend of the application.
The backend application makes the calls to a WebApi with simple Http-requests and sends the data to the WebViewer component.
